# Kafka Realtime Data Streaming

This project demonstrates a real-time data streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka (or AWS Kinesis) for event ingestion, coupled with persistent storage and reporting/analytics for downstream insights. It provides a reference implementation of modern event-driven architecture, enabling scalable, fault-tolerant data processing.
